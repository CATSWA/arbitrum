## Porting to Arbitrum

Existing Ethereum applications can be ported to Arbitrum as long as they only use [supported](Solidity_Support.md) parts of Solidity.

### Prerequisites

The dApp must:

    - Be a Truffle-based project
    - Use web3.js or ethers.js
    - Use webpack or a similar build system

### Overview

Here are the steps needed to port your dApp to Arbitrum:

1. Make sure your dApp compiles and runs correctly on Ethereum or a local testnet
2. Configure the Truffle project to use the Arbitrum Truffle provider and [compile your project to Arbitrum bytecode](Executable_Creation.md)
3. Add the Arbitrum [front-end provider](Frontend_Integration.md)
4. Launch a set of Arbitrum Validators with the bytecode on a [Local Testnet](Local_Blockchain.md) or on [Rinkeby](Rinkeby.md)
5. Launch the front-end of your dApp
